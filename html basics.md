To add any content in the webpage we have a seperate html tag and all the tags are predefined.

TYPES OF TAGS:

->Unpaired Tags

Paired Tags: A tag which is having both opening and closing markup is a paired tag.
eg: <p>......</p>

Unpaired Tag: A tag which has only opening markup is an unpaired tag.

Empty Element is a unpaired tag without having any content they are also known as closing tag.
